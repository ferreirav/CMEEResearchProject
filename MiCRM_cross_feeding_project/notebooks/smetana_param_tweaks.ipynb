    "In this project, I am using data from the Earth Microbiome Project that has around 12,000 samples across diferent enviromental material. This samples have community sizes that spans from 2 species up to 700 species, where most of the sample size distribution are up to 200 species.\n",

    "Recent profiling tests on the pipeline developed so far ((get_interactions.py)[]) show that scaling up the calculation of metabolic interactions from 2 species to 32 could increase the computational time up to 300x more, so taking this initial estimation into account, the calculation for community size of 100 or even 200 species could be massive.\n",
