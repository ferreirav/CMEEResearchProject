## The noteboooks will guide you through the steps that  have taken to develop the data exploration, pipeline devolpement and analysis

1. Start to open the [`exploring_data.ipynb`]() - this notebook will provide a detail workflow to combine data from the Earth Microbiome Project, get the accession numbers to download the organisms genomes and group the samples by environmental material.

2. Open [`pipeline_description.ipynb`]() to follow the first attempt to develop the pipeline. This will combine the use of Python and BASH scripts found in the `code` folder.

3. With the pipeline up and running I have done some profiling using a set of community sizes. The results can be seen in the [`test4speed.ipynb`]()
